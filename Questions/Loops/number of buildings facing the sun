Given an array representing building heights: `[7, 4, 8, 2, 9, 10]`

We want to count how many buildings have a clear view of the sunrise/sunset, meaning they're taller than all buildings to their left.

- Building 1: Height 7 → Clear view (1)
- Building 2: Height 4 → No clear view
- Building 3: Height 8 → Clear view (2)
- Building 4: Height 2 → No clear view
- Building 5: Height 9 → Clear view (3)
- Building 6: Height 10 → Clear view (4)

Thus, there are 4 buildings with a clear view.
